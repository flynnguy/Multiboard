Use “Bolt-Lock Mounts” if you want your entire board or segments of your board to be easily removable, or if you're using Multibin Plates. This mounting method creates a 6.25 mm offset from the surface.

To set it up:

    Use Multiboard Snaps for unconnected removable tiles. Or use Raised Snap Connectors for a connected removable board.
    Secure the Bolt-Lock Mounts to a surface using screws. To align the mounts properly, first attach the mounts to the tiles using temporary passthrough bolts.
    Secure your board to the mounts using Locking Bolts.
