## Double Sided Snap
The “Double-Sided Snap - Part B” joins with any “DS Part A” Snap, like the Double-Sided Snap - Part A or the T Offset Snaps - DS Part A.

Remember: Part A’s join with Part B’s.

When joining them together, make sure to align the two square symbols.

This snap behaves like a regular snap with a push-fit hole to insert push-fit accessories or screw in mid thread bolts.

This part comes with four tolerances: loose (0.65 mm), standard (0.5 mm), tight (0.25 mm) and permanent (0.15 mm).

(If you have to use the loose tolerance to fit this part in, then you’re going to have problems with the rest of the Multiboard system. Calibrate your printer to work with at least the standard tolerance)

You can remove this piece from the Offset Snaps using the Offset Snaps Removal Tool.

## Free Standing Feet
Attach a “free-standing foot” to your Multiboard so it stands by itself, and use it as a desk organizer.

The free-standing foot comes with two pieces: the foot and the support piece.

To set it up, you insert the foot into a hole on the bottom of your Multiboard, then you place the support piece inside the foot to secure it into place.

## Threaded Foot
Use “Thread Feet” and Rods to make your Multiboard stand by itself, it’s an alternative to the Free-Standing Foot.

The advantage of the Thread Foot is that you can extend the length of the rods and make your free-standing Multiboard taller.

To set it up, screw a Big Thread Rod into your tiles, then screw a Thread Foot on both ends of the rod, and finally secure it into place using Big Thread Nuts.
